\section{MLE for Tossing Coin Problem}

Each outcome of this experiment can be thought as a sample of bernoulli distribution. Where $\theta$ is a parameter that controls the distribution.

\begin{equation}
        p\big(y_n | \theta\big) = \theta ^ {y_n} (1 - \theta)^{1 - y_n}
\end{equation}

Since, each outcome is IID. So, overall likelihood distribution is given by the formula below.

\begin{equation*}
        p\big(y | \theta\big) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} \theta ^ {y_n} (1 - \theta)^{1 - y_n}
\end{equation*}
